## Overview

Vim Paint is a re-imagining of Vim if it were an image editor instead of a text
editor. I take many of the concepts found in Vim like the idea of each edit
being a combination of an operator and a motion. Where in regular Vim you might
"delete in word", in Vim Paint you would "delete in pixel", or "delete in area",
or "delete in layer" instead.

Instructions for using Vim Paint including all of the operators, motions, and
other concepts you may need to know to use this program can be found in ![the
Vim Paint primer](./PRIMER.md).

## Setup

You can compile Vim Paint with `make`. The resultant binary will be at
`build/vimpaint`.
